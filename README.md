# EXPRESS AND REACT FULLSTACK WEB APP BOILERPLATE

This is a simple basic boilerplate to have a full-stack web app boiler plate with an express.js backend and react.js frontend.

:warning: DataBase not integrated so do this on your own! :warning:

## What's out of the box?

* backend and frontend linked
* react-router-dom for client side routing included
* scss integration so you can write sexy style with scss!

## Get started

* Make sure to have concurrently, create-react-app, nodemon installed globally. If you don't do so by running: `npm i -g concurrently create-react-app nodemon`

* clone this repo by running `git clone git@github.com:ShinnoT/react-express-boilerplate.git your-app-name`
* then `cd your-app-name`
* then install all the dependencies by running `npm install` both in root folder and client folder

voila! you can now run `npm run dev` in root folder to start your fullstack app!
